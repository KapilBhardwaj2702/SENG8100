Here's a brief `readme.md` for the Grocery Buddies project.

# üõí Grocery Buddies: Data Analysis & Price Prediction

This repository contains the data analysis and machine learning models for the **Grocery Buddies** project. The primary goal is to analyze grocery item data and build a model to accurately predict prices.

## üìù Project Overview

This project walks through a typical data science workflow:

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** We start by loading the dataset, checking for missing values, and understanding its basic statistical properties.
2.  **Feature Engineering:** We create new features (e.g., squared values) to help our model capture non-linear patterns.
3.  **Visualization:** We use histograms and heatmaps to visualize price distributions and feature correlations.
4.  **Machine Learning:** We build two key models:
      * **Linear Regression:** To predict the **price** of an item based on its features (e.g., weight, stock). This model achieved an **R¬≤ score of 0.99**, indicating a very high level of accuracy.
      * **Logistic Regression:** A bonus model to predict the **cheapest store** based on a list of items.

## üöÄ How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:** Make sure you have `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `seaborn` installed.
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
    ```
3.  **Run the notebook:** Open and run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to see the full analysis and model training process.
